# Leaderboard
A simple Qlik Sense visualisation table extension with sorting animation functionality for leaderboard-kind visualisation purposes.
Items going UP in the order are represented by green highlight while items going DOWN are indicated by red highlight.
The order is refreshed each time when a selection is made in the app or after each reload.
